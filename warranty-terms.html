    <h2>Fair Use Policy – BeneSupport Extended Warranty</h2>
    <p>Thank you for choosing BeneSupport. The BeneSupport Extended Warranty is designed to give you added peace of mind. It covers defects in materials or workmanship under normal, responsible use.
    We encourage confident, active living — and our products are built to support your daily movement.</p>
     <div class="section">
    <h2>Coverage Scope</h2>
    <p>The extended warranty <strong>does include</strong> the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Joint support in daily life, exercise, and regular sports</li>
      <li>Use during non-professional athletic activities like jogging, fitness, walking, yoga, cycling</li>
      <li>Functional issues related to seams, stitching, or fasteners under normal use</li>
      <li>Material failure unrelated to misuse</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

        <ul>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, or altering the product structure</li>
          <li>Improper storage in excessively humid or chemical environments</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Loss or theft of the product</li>
      <li>Unusual or extreme usage scenarios, such as intentionally overstretching or over-compressing the material</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Products not purchased from official or authorized sales channels</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
